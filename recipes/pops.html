    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Light, creamy, and refreshing, these easy DIY dreamsicles
        taste like nostalgia on a stick.
        The ice pops can also be made in paper cups instead of
        plastic popsicle molds,
        which can be cut away for easy release.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups orange sherbet, slightly softened</li>
        <li>2 cups vanilla ice cream, slightly softened</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh orange juice</li>
        <li>2/3 cup simple syrup</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine sherbet and ice cream in a large ziplock
            plastic bag. Massage the bag to slightly mix the 2
            colors. Make a 3/4-inch cut in the bottom corner of
            the bag. Squeeze about 3 tablespoons of sherbet
            mixture into each of 10 (3-oz) popsicle molds.</li>

        <li>Stir together orange juice, simple syrup, and cream
            in a liquid measuring cup. Pour juice mixture into
            popsicle molds allowing liquid to fill in any
            remaining air pockets of the ice cream.
            Insert popsicle sticks, and freeze for at least
            8 hours.</li>

    </ol>
